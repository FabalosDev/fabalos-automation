# 🦊 **Fabalos Automation – Portfolio & Case Study System**

A modern SvelteKit-based automation portfolio showcasing real-world case studies in **Make.com, n8n, GPT workflows, and system design**.

This site serves as the official public profile of **Fabalos** — a Mechatronics Engineer turned Automation Architect.

---

# 📘 **README — v1.3.1 Update**

## **Fabalos Automation — v1.3.1**

A refined, stable release focusing on **UI consistency**, **performance optimization**, and **predictable layout behavior** across all blog and case-study components.

---

## **🚀 New in 1.3.1**

### **Image Optimization**

All relevant images now use:

`loading="lazy" decoding="async"`

This significantly improves time-to-render and reduces layout jank on slower connections.

---

## **🎨 Layout & UX Cleanup**

- Footer is now consistently placed **outside** each main section.

- Spacing adjustments prevent elements from overlapping or appearing cramped.

- Blog cards now follow unified styling rules across all pages.

- Category pills gracefully wrap even when there are many categories.


---

## **🧹 Code Cleanup**

- Duplicate CSS blocks removed.

- Global spacing normalized.

- Components updated to align with the **FoxOps UX rules** (clean, consistent, neon-glow aesthetic).


---

## **🛠 Developer Notes**

- Prettier has been corrected to use the proper extension (non-legacy).

- Svelte formatting is consistent across workspace.

- PATCH-only workflow is now the standard to minimize cascading layout issues.


---

## **📌 Next Targets (v1.3.2 Preview)**

- Optional: Move repetition-heavy styles to global CSS.

- Optional: Turn blog + case study card into a reusable component.

- Optional: Add Cloudinary resizing URLs for even faster loads.

		<!-- 🔸 Core Statement -->
		<p class="text-soft text-lg leading-relaxed">
			Fabalos Automation is a solo engineering studio built on one simple idea:
			<strong>systems should work harder than you do.</strong>
		</p>

		<!-- 🔸 Brand Definition -->
		<p class="text-soft leading-relaxed">
			I design and build automation architectures using
			<strong>Make.com</strong>, <strong>GPT</strong>, and <strong>n8n</strong>. Every workflow is
			engineered for clarity, reliability, and scale — whether it's product tagging, full-process
			orchestration, or end-to-end internal tooling.
		</p>

		<!-- 🔸 Signature Vibe -->
		<p class="text-soft text-base italic">
			I’m a Mechatronics engineer turned Automation Architect, blending hard logic with intentional,
			user-first system design. No fluff, no guesswork — just clean automation that moves with
			purpose.

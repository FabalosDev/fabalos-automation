  "problem": "Manual product tagging became increasingly inefficient as the product catalog grew. Inconsistent categories, missing metadata, and human error reduced storefront usability and slowed internal operations.",
  "solution": "A Make.com automation workflow was built to analyze product titles and descriptions using NLP, classify items into structured categories, and apply standardized tags directly in Shopify. Fallback logic ensures stability when data is incomplete.",
  "result": "Manual tagging was eliminated, category consistency improved, and product publishing became significantly faster. The system now scales automatically as inventory expands.",

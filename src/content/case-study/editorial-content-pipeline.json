  "problem": "The editorial team relied on manual copying, cleanup, and categorization of news articles. This resulted in duplicate content, inconsistent formatting, slow turnaround times, and high cognitive load for editors.",
  "solution": "I designed an automated editorial pipeline using n8n that scrapes articles from multiple sources, resolves redirect links, cleans the content, removes duplicates using UUID checks, and structures the output into AI-ready drafts.",
  "result": "The system reduced manual editorial work by over 80%, eliminated duplicate entries, standardized article structure, and enabled editors to focus purely on review and decision-making instead of data preparation.",
